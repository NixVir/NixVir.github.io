Growing shares of U.S. adults say they are using Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp and Reddit, but YouTube still rises to the top.

YouTube remains the dominant platform with 84% of U.S. adults reporting they use it, followed by Facebook at 71%. Half of Americans now use Instagram, while TikTok has grown to 37% adoption. WhatsApp (32%), Reddit (26%), and Snapchat (25%) round out the mid-tier platforms, with X (formerly Twitter) at 21%. Newer platforms like Threads (8%), Bluesky (4%), and Truth Social (3%) have yet to achieve mainstream adoption.
