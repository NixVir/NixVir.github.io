We've added a new Sports Betting Activity section to the [Nixvir Dashboard](/dashboard.html), tracking gaming metrics as a competing discretionary spend indicator for the ski industry.

**Why track sports betting?** A significant market for new skiers and snowboarders is adult males ages 18-35. To the extent that some of these individuals are more focused on sports betting than in the past, it may reduce their discretionary income and therefore reduce their participation frequency—or their likelihood of picking up skiing or snowboarding at all.

The new section includes:

- **U.S. Trailing 12-Month Handle** - Total dollars wagered across all legal U.S. states over the past year
- **U.S. Latest Month** - Most recent monthly sports betting handle, with seasonality following major sports calendars (NFL, NBA, MLB)
- **Ontario Annual Handle** - Canada's largest sports betting market, which launched regulated iGaming in April 2022
- **Monthly Handle Trend Chart** - Visualizing the rapid growth trajectory since 2019
- **Annual U.S. Handle Totals** - Year-over-year comparisons showing market expansion

In 2019, only a handful of states had legal sports betting. By 2024, 38 states plus D.C. were operational, and the market continues to expand rapidly.

Data sourced from [Sports Handle](https://sportshandle.com/sports-betting-revenue/) (U.S.) and [iGaming Ontario](https://igamingontario.ca) (Canada).
