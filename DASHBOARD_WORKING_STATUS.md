## ⚠️ Display Issue (Not Critical)

### Symptom
Dashboard page shows "Loading..." instead of displaying the data.

### Root Cause
Likely **browser caching** - the page JavaScript was loaded before the data file existed.

### Solution (Choose One)

#### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Easiest)
1. Visit: https://confident-jang-4183f9.netlify.app/dashboard/
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
3. This forces a full page reload, bypassing cache

#### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open browser settings
2. Clear browsing data / Clear cache
3. Revisit the dashboard

#### Option 3: Private/Incognito Window
1. Open incognito/private browsing window
2. Visit: https://confident-jang-4183f9.netlify.app/dashboard/
3. Should load fresh with no cache

#### Option 4: Wait for Next Deploy
- Netlify will redeploy on next git push
- Dashboard will work after fresh deployment
- Next automated update will also trigger deploy

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Still Shows "Loading..." After Hard Refresh

1. **Check browser console**:
   - Press F12
   - Click "Console" tab
   - Look for errors

2. **Common errors**:
   - CORS error: Not applicable (same origin)
   - 404 error: We verified file exists
   - Network error: Check internet connection

3. **Manual test**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Paste this code:
   ```javascript
   fetch('/data/dashboard.json')
     .then(r => r.json())
     .then(d => console.log('Data loaded:', d))
     .catch(e => console.error('Error:', e))
   ```
   - Should log the dashboard data

### If Automation Stops Working

1. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/NixVir/NixVir.github.io/actions
2. Look for failed runs (red X)
3. Click on failed run to see error logs
4. Common issues:
   - API rate limit exceeded (wait 1 hour)
   - API key expired (update in GitHub Secrets)
   - Network timeout (will retry next day)
