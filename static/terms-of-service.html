        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="policy-effective-date">Effective Date: February 16, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the use of the NixVir LLC ("NixVir," "we," "us," or "our") website (nixvir.com) and the professional consulting services we provide. By engaging NixVir for services or using our website, you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Services</h2>
        <p>NixVir provides data analytics, strategic planning, information technology solutions, business intelligence, and related consulting services. The specific scope, deliverables, timeline, and fees for each engagement are defined in a separate written agreement, proposal, or statement of work between NixVir and the client.</p>

        <h2>2. Client Data and Confidentiality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidential Treatment.</strong> All data, documents, and information provided by the client in connection with an engagement ("Client Data") will be treated as confidential. NixVir will not disclose Client Data to third parties without the client's prior written consent, except as required by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose Limitation.</strong> Client Data will be used solely for the purposes defined in the applicable engagement agreement.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Security.</strong> NixVir employs reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Client Data against unauthorized access, alteration, loss, or destruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Return and Destruction.</strong> Upon completion of an engagement, or promptly upon the client's request, NixVir will return or securely destroy Client Data in accordance with the terms of the engagement agreement. NixVir may retain copies of work product and deliverables as part of its professional records, subject to ongoing confidentiality obligations. Where a separate confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement is in effect, the retention and protection terms of that agreement shall govern.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Work Product.</strong> Unless otherwise specified in the engagement agreement, deliverables created by NixVir for a client become the property of the client upon final payment. This includes reports, analyses, databases, visualizations, and other materials produced specifically for the engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Retained Rights.</strong> NixVir retains the right to use general methodologies, techniques, know-how, tools, and non-proprietary frameworks developed or used during engagements. Publicly available data remains in the public domain.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-Existing IP.</strong> Any tools, libraries, or intellectual property that NixVir owned prior to the engagement remain the property of NixVir. Where such materials are incorporated into deliverables, the client receives a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use them as part of the delivered work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>Payment terms are defined in each engagement agreement. Unless otherwise specified, invoices are due within 30 days of receipt. NixVir reserves the right to suspend work on an engagement if payments are materially overdue.</p>

        <h2>5. Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>NixVir will perform services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards.</li>
            <li>Analyses, projections, and recommendations are based on data available at the time of the engagement and represent professional judgment, not guarantees of outcomes.</li>
            <li>Except as expressly stated in an engagement agreement, services are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, NixVir's total liability for any claim arising from an engagement shall not exceed the fees paid by the client for the specific engagement giving rise to the claim. NixVir shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits or business opportunities, regardless of the theory of liability.</p>

        <h2>7. Subcontractors</h2>
        <p>NixVir may engage subcontractors to assist with specific engagement tasks. Subcontractors are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those set forth in these Terms and any applicable engagement or non-disclosure agreement. NixVir remains responsible for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors in connection with client engagements.</p>

        <h2>8. Independent Contractor</h2>
        <p>NixVir operates as an independent contractor. Nothing in these Terms or any engagement agreement creates an employment, partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between NixVir and the client.</p>

        <h2>9. Website Use</h2>
        <p>The content on nixvir.com is provided for informational purposes. While we strive to keep information accurate and current, we make no warranties about the completeness or accuracy of website content. The data tools and visualizations on our site are demonstrations of our capabilities and should not be relied upon for business decisions without independent verification.</p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>Either party may terminate an engagement as provided in the applicable engagement agreement. In the absence of specific termination provisions, either party may terminate with 30 days' written notice. Upon termination, the client is responsible for fees for work completed through the termination date, and NixVir will deliver all completed and in-progress work product.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a revised effective date. Individual engagement agreements take precedence over these general Terms where they conflict.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, United States. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Colorado.</p>
