      "content": "McCall, Idaho \u2014 The Western United States\u2019 ski season has been (to put it nicely) bleak. So it comes as a surprise when a ski resort boasts about its conditions. Yesterday, Brundage Mountain Resort shared with us that it remains 100% open despite what\u2019s been a dry winter for Idaho. All its trails and lifts are open, making it the largest ski resort in the Northeast to have all its terrain open. Brundage has been able to pull this off \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough winter across the entire West,\u201d said Ken Rider, general manager of Brundage Mountain Resort. \u201cWe want to spread the word that we\u2019re in the great position here at Brundage Mountain heading into Presidents Weekend with the entire mountain open for our guests.\u201d Review of Brundage from the 2024-25 season. If you\u2019re a skier with a season pass looking for better conditions, Brundage is offering a nice deal. In honor of their 65th season of independence, Brundage is offering $65 lift tickets to passholders from other mountains. This deal is val",

Image \u00a9 PlanetSKI I have stayed in the resort of Kicking Horse itself a few times. In the town of Golden 13kms away in the valley below.

Kicking Horse, British Columbia, Canada. Image \u00a9 PlanetSKI Kicking Horse is probably my favourite Canadian resort. Firstly it has some of the finest and most challenging skiing \u2013 from the steep shutes and wide open powder bowls, to the groomers.

      "content": "Noah Dines is pretty much as close to superhuman as one can get in ski mountaineering. He holds the world record for the most human-powered vertical feet skied in a year, totaling 3,590,097 feet. For 348 days, Noah skied an average of more than 10,000 feet a day. Alex Hackel is a top-notch skier in his own right, earning both a bronze and silver medal at the X Games in Real Ski. He is not a ski mountaineer, but he decided to race Noah Dines in a skimo race anyways. He gave himself a little boost for the contest, though, wearing the Hypershell X Series exoskeleton to see if it could give him enough of a boost to beat a world record holder. Despite throwing several challenges in Noah\u2019s way, Alex having a mechanical boost, and Alex fully skipping a lap to make it a closer race, Noah was able to secure the win. That said, it is very interesting to see how the exoskeleton gave Alex an overall boost on the uphill, even if it wasn\u2019t enough to beat the world record holder. The Future Of Boot F",

The Chainsmokers are known for songs like Closer , Something Just Like This , Don\u2019t Let Me Down , and Roses . General admission tickets unsurprisingly sold out quickly. Some expensive options remain available, including table and private cabin reservations. View this post on Instagram Currently, Aspen Mountain has 91 of 104 trails open.
