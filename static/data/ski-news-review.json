It seamlessly integrates with the Village at Sugar Bowl , another major California ski resort. Visitors can engage in some classic striding to XC skating and snowshoeing, all with some stunning views of the Sierra.

The ski and recreation industries in the state are continuing to deal with the fallout of a 2014 Oregon Supreme Court decision. This ruling against Mt.

This has led to rising insurance prices in the region, with only one provider remaining that covers the ski industry. So far, the impacts have included the permanent closure of mountain biking at Mt. Hood Ski Bowl and an increase in prices at Timberline Lodge . If damaging verdicts continue to happen, ski areas are at risk of closure. In response, one lawmaker plans to introduce new protections for the ski and outdoor recreation industry. OPB reports that Senator Mark Meek (D-Gladstone) intends to introduce legislation requiring users to sign liability waivers before participating in activities, such as shredding at a ski resort.

The woman stopped near a sign on the trail and flagged the snowboarder down, letting him know that she believed he was acting dangerously. The snowboarder stated that he had always been downhill of her and thus always had the right of way. He then rode off. The woman and her husband apparently continued to follow the man, skiing near him down the mountain.

However, the White Pine Resort just announced its first notable changes since new ownership arrived. Yesterday, White Pine Resort revealed its rebrand. This includes a new logo, website, and trail map. The logo is simple and evokes a mountainous environment. The new website is working through the kinks, but it\u2019s modern and easy to use. The new trail map shows the trail and provides a better perspective on its surroundings than the prior map. This rebrand will also include new gear and clothes at the ski resort\u2019s retail shop. View this post on Instagram The other major change is to its operating schedule. The ski resort will now operate Thursday-Sunday, and on select Mondays (i.e., Holiday periods).

      "content": "In some sports, the requirement of a helmet can feel a bit more like an accessory than an actually needed piece of equipment. In both mountaineering and climbing, a helmet won\u2019t protect you much from a fall, but they\u2019ll certainly keep you safe from falling rocks. This video, shared by Dallas Poulson , demonstrates that concept. The clip was captured on Gran Paradiso\u2019s standard route in the Italian Alps. Fortunately nobody was hurt, but it\u2019s still a good reminder as to why helmets are so important. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dallas Poulson (@dallaspoulson) If either of the big chunks had hit a person, a helmet probably wouldn\u2019t have done much life saving. But all of the smaller chunks created by the large fall could do plenty of damage, including deadly damage, to someone who wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet.

      "content": "Ski/snowboard collisions are often pretty cut and dry. The downhill skier has the right of way, thus when an accident occurs it\u2019s generally the uphill skier who gets the blame. But occasionally accidents occur that aren\u2019t so simply analyzed. This appears to be one of those accidents. The skier and snowboarder both come around a corner, see each other, and slam on the breaks, but they notice too late. Both parties should not have been entering a blind spot that quickly, so it seems like both deserve some blame. It\u2019s always important that you stay in control and always be aware of what\u2019s below you on the slopes. In this case, the accident occurred in what looks like the start of a lift line, a place where you absolutely should not be going at high speeds. If you\u2019re going a speed around a blind corner with enough speed that you won\u2019t be able to stop if something appears in front of you, then you\u2019re going too fast, plain and simple.
