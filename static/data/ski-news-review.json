It seamlessly integrates with the Village at Sugar Bowl , another major California ski resort. Visitors can engage in some classic striding to XC skating and snowshoeing, all with some stunning views of the Sierra.

The ski and recreation industries in the state are continuing to deal with the fallout of a 2014 Oregon Supreme Court decision. This ruling against Mt.

This has led to rising insurance prices in the region, with only one provider remaining that covers the ski industry. So far, the impacts have included the permanent closure of mountain biking at Mt. Hood Ski Bowl and an increase in prices at Timberline Lodge . If damaging verdicts continue to happen, ski areas are at risk of closure. In response, one lawmaker plans to introduce new protections for the ski and outdoor recreation industry. OPB reports that Senator Mark Meek (D-Gladstone) intends to introduce legislation requiring users to sign liability waivers before participating in activities, such as shredding at a ski resort.

The woman stopped near a sign on the trail and flagged the snowboarder down, letting him know that she believed he was acting dangerously. The snowboarder stated that he had always been downhill of her and thus always had the right of way. He then rode off. The woman and her husband apparently continued to follow the man, skiing near him down the mountain.

The agency said on Thursday that as of Nov. 1, 210,139 Coloradans have enrolled in a health insurance plan for next year, a roughly 5% decrease compared to the same period in 2024. Approximately 296,499 people ended up enrolling in a plan in 2025. Open enrollment began on Nov. 1 and will last through Jan. 15, though Coloradans must enroll by Dec. 15 for coverage that starts Jan. 1. The state said there are a few factors that may be contributing to the small dip in enrollment, including rising health insurance premiums as a result of expiring federal tax credits. Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies were first passed by Congress in 2021 and extended in 2022 and are now set to lapse on Dec. 31.

Family and Intercultural Resource Center Director of Development Hallie Jaeger, who has worked for a handful of Summit County nonprofits serving a variety of needs, said Colorado Gives Day is important to Summit\u2019s nonprofit landscape across the board. \u201cColorado Gives Day (was) founded on this premise of helping grass roots or smaller organizations who don\u2019t have the capacity to have a donation portal or a website, and it has been so incredible for local nonprofits,\u201d she said. She said for larger nonprofits, it provides a convenient portal for donors. She said no matter the size of the nonprofit, the day matters in their efforts to give back to the community they serve. \u201cEverybody\u2019s dollars are being invested directly back into the community, whether that is helping feed people, helping with community health programs, helping give people access to the mountain \u2026 helping build",

      "content": "Connect for Health Colorado, the state\u2019s individual marketplace where people shop for and buy their own health insurance plans, is seeing a slight dip in enrollment for 2026 compared to the same time last year. The agency said on Thursday that as of Nov. 1, 210,139 Coloradans have enrolled in a health insurance plan for next year, a roughly 5% decrease compared to the same period in 2024. Approximately 296,499 people ended up enrolling in a plan in 2025. Open enrollment began on Nov. 1 and will last through Jan. 15, though Coloradans must enroll by Dec. 15 for coverage that starts Jan. 1. The state said there are a few factors that may be contributing to the small dip in enrollment, including rising health insurance premiums as a result of expiring federal tax credits. Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies were first passed by Congress in 2021 and extended in 2022 and are now set to lapse on Dec. 31. The tax credits helped lower insurance premiums on Affordable Care A",

      "content": "Thanks to market swings, evolving tax laws and new technology, it may be a good year to consider tax-loss harvesting \u2014 a strategy that can help reduce taxes and improve long-term returns. What is tax-loss harvesting? When you sell an investment for less than you paid, you may be able to use that loss to offset gains from other investments, potentially reducing your overall tax bill. If your total capital losses exceed your gains, you can use up to $3,000 of those losses to reduce your ordinary income each year. You can carry any remaining losses forward to future tax years. The strategy doesn\u2019t eliminate taxes; it simply defers them, freeing up money to reinvest elsewhere. How it works Imagine an investor who sold one stock for a $10,000 gain and another for a $10,000 loss. The two transactions cancel each other out, meaning no capital gains tax is owed for that year. The investor can then reinvest the proceeds while following the IRS\u2019s \u201cwash-sale rule.\u201d This rule prevents you from cla",

The new trail map shows the trail and provides a better perspective on its surroundings than the prior map. This rebrand will also include new gear and clothes at the ski resort\u2019s retail shop.

In both mountaineering and climbing, a helmet won\u2019t protect you much from a fall, but they\u2019ll certainly keep you safe from falling rocks. This video, shared by Dallas Poulson , demonstrates that concept. The clip was captured on Gran Paradiso\u2019s standard route in the Italian Alps. Fortunately nobody was hurt, but it\u2019s still a good reminder as to why helmets are so important. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dallas Poulson (@dallaspoulson) If either of the big chunks had hit a person, a helmet probably wouldn\u2019t have done much life saving. But all of the smaller chunks created by the large fall could do plenty of damage, including deadly damage, to someone who wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet.

      "content": "Ski/snowboard collisions are often pretty cut and dry. The downhill skier has the right of way, thus when an accident occurs it\u2019s generally the uphill skier who gets the blame. But occasionally accidents occur that aren\u2019t so simply analyzed. This appears to be one of those accidents. The skier and snowboarder both come around a corner, see each other, and slam on the breaks, but they notice too late. Both parties should not have been entering a blind spot that quickly, so it seems like both deserve some blame. It\u2019s always important that you stay in control and always be aware of what\u2019s below you on the slopes. In this case, the accident occurred in what looks like the start of a lift line, a place where you absolutely should not be going at high speeds. If you\u2019re going a speed around a blind corner with enough speed that you won\u2019t be able to stop if something appears in front of you, then you\u2019re going too fast, plain and simple.
