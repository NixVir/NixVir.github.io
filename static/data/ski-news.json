      "content": "Canada is home to a lot of intense ski resorts with some proper expert in-bound terrain, but few are quite as intimidating as Sunshine Village\u2019s Delirium Dive. It\u2019s an in-bound run and it\u2019s mitigate by ski patrol, but the trail is still guarded with some serious security. To get onto the run, skiers must first pass through a gate that ensures they\u2019re wearing an avalanche beacon. Additionally, the resort requires that all who attempt it have full avalanche gear and are with a partner. That\u2019s not unheard of at ski resorts in North America, but it\u2019s certainly rare. German ski instructor Marius Quast took on the wild run while visiting the continent. Skiers who pass through the intimidating gate (with avalanche gear and a partner) are able to access a fair number of options to check out, including some wild chutes with 2,500 feet of steep vertical and open bowls.

More significantly, Montana state tourism officials have documented approximately a 25% decline in Canadian visitors since tariff announcements and inflammatory political rhetoric. The Whitefish Mountain Resort, located 60 miles south of the Canadian border, typically derives one-quarter of its revenue from Canadian guests.

The broader U.S. Travel Association projects 5 million fewer international visitors nationwide this year. Tourism officials emphasize they welcome Canadian visitors.

Uncertainty dominates planning as domestic tourism has partially offset Canadian declines, though last-minute bookings complicate business forecasting.",

Trail Ridge , known in its final years as Nebraski, was a ski area that operated from 1981 to 1996. It was situated between the cities of Omaha and Lincoln, making it accessible to many. The ski area had a short operational history due to its southern exposure and lack of natural snowfall. However, Nerbraski is one of the sickest ski area names ever. In this video by Skiers and Snowboarders of the Midwest , he uses a drone to capture the remains of the ski area. The physical infrastructure appears to have been removed, but you can still see the layout of many of the old ski trails.

At some resorts in North America, a single day of skiing can cost $300+, while $300 would usually cover at least a few days of skiing in Europe. But the mountains of Austria, Germany, Italy, and France can still be fairly expensive. German skier and adventure Marlene took a look at Europe\u2019s most expensive resorts for the 2025/2026 ski season. According to her analysis, Zermatt in Switzerland is the most expensive ski area in Europe, costing around 540 CHF, or a little more than $670, for six days of skiing. That\u2019s still more than $110 for a day. She points to St. Moritz , again in Switzerland, as the second most expensive, costing around 520 CHF, or around $647 USD, for 6 days. Of course, with those being the most expensive resorts in Europe, they hardly compare to the United States. A week at Aspen Snowmass , the most expensive resort in the U.S., can easily cost well over $1,00",
