Fortunately mid-February looks like it will come with a major pattern change across the Western United States, potentially bringing some solid snowfall to the Colorado Rockies, but it\u2019s still worth noting that much of this season probably wouldn\u2019t exist without the hard work of snowmakers.

This wasn\u2019t the first time someone\u2019s flown a drone to the summit of the iconic European peak, but the fact that this is a high-end piece of equipment with a very nice camera truly shines in the footage. It\u2019s absolutely stunning to look at. Noah has a ton of very cool drone footage on his YouTube channel, with shots of water, mountains, and stunning scenery. Make sure",

      "content": "Late January \u2013 1 February 2026 Over the past week, avalanche activity across the Alps has followed a clear and worrying pattern. From the Mont Blanc massif to the Queyras and across into the Swiss Valais, numerous skier-triggered and spontaneous avalanches point to a snowpack that remains structurally unstable , despite periods of fair weather and already-tracked slopes. Rather than isolated incidents, the reports collected since late January describe reactive slabs, remote triggers, and persistent weak layers affecting a wide range of aspects and elevations. Much of the recent instability is consistent with wind-loaded slabs and foehn-driven snow transport , which can rapidly overload weak layers and create large, reactive avalanche conditions.

This update summarises the most significant recent events and explains what they tell us about current conditions. Widesp",
