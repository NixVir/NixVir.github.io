Early in the week, as forecasts began hinting at a major storm, Malzbender tossed out a casual post on TikTok about organizing a Central Park ski meetup. The response snowballed quickly. What began as a simple idea turned into a group chat of nearly 180 skiers, all intrigued by the idea of sliding through one of the world\u2019s most iconic urban parks. While it was a far cry from the deep, consistent snowpacks of her hometown, Boulder, Colorado, Malzbender saw opportunity",

For more information, check out the video below and a written explainer of the expansion. Revelator & Vulcan Originally, Deer Valley intended to have these be one continuous lift. However, due to the differences in terrain, in order to improve lapability, they went with two separate chairlifts. I\u2019ll have to ski it to form a true opinion, but I feel like splitting these into two is the right decision. Just one run in this area looks like a true thigh burner.

Purely natural snow resorts are currently benefiting from the snow conditions and are following suit. Particularly pleasing is the high demand for ski courses, primarily among young people, and the large number of sunbathers who, in addition to winter sports enthusiasts, are drawn to the mountains by the fantastic winter weather.

They\u2019ve done a lot in the past to do that, including skiing on enormous, 11-foot-long skis , but this new style of skiing seems to take it to the next level. Using FPV goggles, a camera, and a pretty impressive rig, they managed to set up a real-life 3rd person skiing experience. For those who aren\u2019t aware, the idea of a 3rd person view (beyond the storytelling third-person) comes from video games in which the player views the player-character from a behind and slightly above perspective.
