The typical rule is that the skis should stand somewhere between your chin and the top of your head, but knowing exactly where the skis should lie within that range is a bit more complicated. For those who don\u2019t know, shorter skis are more nimble and easier to turn, but they tend to be less stable at high speeds. Longer, on the other hand, means much more stability at speed, but they can be significantly harder to turn and usually require dialed-in technique. Professional skier Alex Hackel compared some of the shortest skis available on the market to some of the longest, really emphasizing their differences. If you\u2019re a beginner or just generally in the market for a new pair of skis and aren\u2019t sure what to get, you should head into a ski shop and talk to someone who knows what they\u2019re doing.

The plan was simple: go chip at some ice and get back in the flow with the technique. In ice climbing, you want to try to have a solid base with your footing and to get the ice axes over the tops of each other to have the most leverage. John Kingsland chipping axes one over the other.

This gives the feeling like you are in a climbing gym and greatly reduces the risks. The ice flow we were on is known in the area as Genesis 1. Another group working on their craft.
