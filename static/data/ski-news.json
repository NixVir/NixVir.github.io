An example of this is from Reddit user r/funpow , who apparently likes skiing powder. He compiled two clips for this video that feature some pretty brutal crashes at Palisades Tahoe. The first clip shows him jumping off a huge cliff and then going head over heels with a frontflip crash. Tears for Fears must be so proud. The second clip starts well, with a sweet wall ride, then he glides through powder. When he stops, he proceeds to get ran the f\u2026 over by another skier.

To access these bowls, skiers and snowboarders travel through Spanky\u2019s Ladder, a choke point that, in extreme cases, can create quite a terrifying crowd. Apparently some skiers and snowboarders decided they were too good to wait in line on a busy day, riding ahead and forging their own path.

      "content": "Broomfield, Colorado \u2014 If recently released metrics from Vail Resorts are any indication, it could be the worst winter in modern history for the U.S. ski industry. Yesterday, Vail Resorts announced its skier metrics for the first portion of the 2025-26 season. The metrics aren\u2019t pretty. Skier visits are down 20% year over year. Other reported metrics include dining revenue down 15.9%, ski school revenue down 14.9%, and retail/rental revenue diminishing by 6.0%. The least-horrible metric is lift ticket revenue, which is down only 1.8%. Here\u2019s what Vail Resorts CEO Rob Katz said regarding the start of the 2025-26 ski season: \u201cWe experienced one of the worst early season snowfalls in the western U.S. in over 30 years, which limited our ability to open terrain and negatively impacted visitation and ancillary spending for both local and destination guests during the period. Snowfall at our western U.S. resorts for November and December was approximately 50% below the historical 30-year aver",

Large, high-altitude, snow-sure French resorts are rising in popularity compared to last year, whilst budget Bulgarian favourites continue to hold their ground.

Unfortunately those deep conditions brought their own danger, with quite a few avalanche deaths occurring throughout the mountain range in the past week. The northern and western Alps saw up to a meter, or a little over 3 feet, in a 3-4 day span from Wednesday through Saturday. It wasn\u2019t the biggest storm of the season, but it brought some exceptional conditions. The best snow was found in Savoie, Les 3 Vall\u00e9es, the Chamonix area, and parts of Switzerland and Austria. Unfortunately the conditions in the Dolomites weren\u2019t quite as good. Warm temperatures and wind transformed much of the snow by Monday and Tuesday, turning much of the powder into crusty or slushy conditions. While groomed runs are excellent, the off-piste powder is getting much harder to find. Tragically at least 6 people died in avalanches in France alone over the last week, with m",

The typical rule is that the skis should stand somewhere between your chin and the top of your head, but knowing exactly where the skis should lie within that range is a bit more complicated. For those who don\u2019t know, shorter skis are more nimble and easier to turn, but they tend to be less stable at high speeds. Longer, on the other hand, means much more stability at speed, but they can be significantly harder to turn and usually require dialed-in technique. Professional skier Alex Hackel compared some of the shortest skis available on the market to some of the longest, really emphasizing their differences. If you\u2019re a beginner or just generally in the market for a new pair of skis and aren\u2019t sure what to get, you should head into a ski shop and talk to someone who knows what they\u2019re doing.
