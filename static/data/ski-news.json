Happo-One played host to the 1998 Winter Olympics and is considered the most alpine area in the Hakuba Valley with long runs, challenging slopes, a true alpine feel. Quast then popped over to Hakuba Cortina famous for its dense forest and deep powder, otherwise known as called Japow.

      "content": "There are a lot of notoriously steep ski trails int he United States, but no man-made/tree-cut ski run in the country can beat Rambo at Crested Butte Mountain Resort . As the steepest in-bound tree-cut run, Rambo offers a consistent 55-degree pitch with exposed rocks, trees, and major moguls. If the features weren\u2019t enough to make you turn away, know that even the resort\u2019s ski patrol often admits that the conditions are basically never good. With all that combined, you can probably imagine that wiping out isn\u2019t the best move, but this video really makes it evident. A wipeout on Rambo often means sliding all the way to the bottom, potentially losing your skis and requiring a hike back up in the process. If you\u2019re hoping to hit the steepest man-made run in the United States, make sure you understand your limits and do so with caution. Once you start, there\u2019s very little ability to bail.

The resort, considered one of eastern North America's premier ski destinations, had warned that continuing operations beyond the end of January would be impossible without a resolution.

An example of this is from Reddit user r/funpow , who apparently likes skiing powder. He compiled two clips for this video that feature some pretty brutal crashes at Palisades Tahoe. The first clip shows him jumping off a huge cliff and then going head over heels with a frontflip crash. Tears for Fears must be so proud. The second clip starts well, with a sweet wall ride, then he glides through powder. When he stops, he proceeds to get ran the f\u2026 over by another skier. Comedy of errors on this run by u/funpow in skiing While he may have had a tough day out there, at least it made for some entertaining viewing.

Warm temperatures and wind transformed much of the snow by Monday and Tuesday, turning much of the powder into crusty or slushy conditions.

As part of the podcast, they interviewed Joe Prokop (longtime Alta passholder), Sam Weintrub (Co-Founder of PeakRankings), and Glen Merrill (SLC meteorologist with the National Weather Service) to discuss the issues that Utah ski industry faces. They discuss the following issues: overcrowding in the mountains, the impact of multi-mountain passes on lift lines and parking, and Utah\u2019s changing climate. Why I Don\u2019t Think It\u2019s Going Bust It\u2019s true that Utah\u2019s most uncrowded days are behind it. The times that fixed-grip lifts helped Utah hold onto powder for days are over.
