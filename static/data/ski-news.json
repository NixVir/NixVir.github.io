It\u2019s an in-bound run and it\u2019s mitigate by ski patrol, but the trail is still guarded with some serious security. To get onto the run, skiers must first pass through a gate that ensures they\u2019re wearing an avalanche beacon. Additionally, the resort requires that all who attempt it have full avalanche gear and are with a partner. That\u2019s not unheard of at ski resorts in North America, but it\u2019s certainly rare. German ski instructor Marius Quast took on the wild run while visiting the continent. Skiers who pass through the intimidating gate (with avalanche gear and a partner) are able to access a fair number of options to check out, including some wild chutes with 2,500 feet of steep vertical and open bowls.

Based on his explanation, late November was impressively snowy across the Alps, with the northwest region (specifically Savoie in France and Valais in Switzerland) seeing the most. Some areas, like Avoriaz, Flaine, and the Mont Blanc range, saw their snowiest late-November in nearly 30 years, with base depths reaching 1.5\u20132 meters.

      "content": "Libby, Montana \u2014 Being off the grid can be challenging. It means that your access to power sources can be limited. This makes some remote ski areas rely on generators. This is the case for Turner Mountain , a small ski area (albeit with a pretty big vertical drop) in Montana. For power, it has been using a used generator from 2001. However, that generator is nearing the end of its usefulness. In response, Turner Mountain has started a fundraiser to install a new main electrical generator. If you\u2019re interested in helping out, you can mail a check to the following address: Kootenai Winter Sports Ski Education Foundation, Inc. PO Box 210 Libby, MT 59923 Unfortunately, they aren\u2019t doing Venmo or a GoFundMe, but I suggest to them that it would be a wise route to take in order to reach people outside of the area.

      "content": "Canada is home to many ski resorts with a wide range terrain, including several of the largest ski resorts in North America. But when it comes to extreme terrain, very little compares to Kicking Horse . Kicking Horse has some proper challenging terrain, with steep. chutes, cliffs, couloirs, and lots of hike-to zones filling the mountain. Several of these hike-to zones include runs that require straight-lining or mandatory airs. Combining all of that, PeakRankings points to the British Columbia ski resort as one of Canada\u2019s most extreme. @peakrankings @kickinghorsemtn boasts some of the most intense expert terrain in the world, with chutes, cliffs, and couloirs that are accessible directly off the lifts. And for those looking for an even greater challenge, the resort is home to copious hike-to terrain, with lines off these hikes that are even more gnarly than the ones off the lifts, often requiring mandatory straightlining or hidden cliff drops. And one of the craziest parts about Kicki",
