Today, that assumption no longer holds. A new technical document published by Fondazione Montagna Sicura , in collaboration with Italy\u2019s Civil Protection system and scientific partners, makes this very clear: glacial and periglacial areas are becoming more unstable, more unpredictable, and more dangerous \u2014 and everyone involved in mountain management needs to adapt. The report, \u201cGlacial and Periglacial Risk in Alpine Environments \u2013 A Methodological Framework\u201d , is not written for tourists.
