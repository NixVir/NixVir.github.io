      "content": "La Veta, Colorado \u2014 A ski area comeback years in the making celebrated a historic milestone last Saturday. On Saturday, Cuchara Mountain Park opened up for the 2025-26 season. For the past few years, operations revolved around bringing guests up on a carriage attached to the snowcat. For this ski season, they were able to reopen the chairlift that volunteers have been working on for years to get operational. Those dreams became a reality on Saturday, as Lift 4 reopened to the public. Crowds gathered at the base of Lift 4 to watch a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Cuchara Mountain operated with various owners from 1981 to 2000. It sat abandoned for years, but the county purchased it in 2017 and converted it into a non-profit operation. The old Lift 4 serves a small footprint of the old ski resort. Lift 4 serves 9 trails across 47 skiable acres with a vertical drop of 300 feet. The old Lift 4 is a Riblet double chairlift that was installed in 1981. The chairlift can carry 1,200 people per hour ",
