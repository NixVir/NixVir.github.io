As the steepest in-bound tree-cut run, Rambo offers a consistent 55-degree pitch with exposed rocks, trees, and major moguls. If the features weren\u2019t enough to make you turn away, know that even the resort\u2019s ski patrol often admits that the conditions are basically never good. With all that combined, you can probably imagine that wiping out isn\u2019t the best move, but this video really makes it evident. A wipeout on Rambo often means sliding all the way to the bottom, potentially losing your skis and requiring a hike back up in the process.

By leaving the board free to twist outside of the central mount, it allows the rider to control the twist of the board separately from the overall edge angle.

Warm temperatures and wind transformed much of the snow by Monday and Tuesday, turning much of the powder into crusty or slushy conditions.
