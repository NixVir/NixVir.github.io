      "content": "Canada is home to a lot of intense ski resorts with some proper expert in-bound terrain, but few are quite as intimidating as Sunshine Village\u2019s Delirium Dive. It\u2019s an in-bound run and it\u2019s mitigate by ski patrol, but the trail is still guarded with some serious security. To get onto the run, skiers must first pass through a gate that ensures they\u2019re wearing an avalanche beacon. Additionally, the resort requires that all who attempt it have full avalanche gear and are with a partner. That\u2019s not unheard of at ski resorts in North America, but it\u2019s certainly rare. German ski instructor Marius Quast took on the wild run while visiting the continent. Skiers who pass through the intimidating gate (with avalanche gear and a partner) are able to access a fair number of options to check out, including some wild chutes with 2,500 feet of steep vertical and open bowls.

Europe, on the other hand, is enjoying a rather successful start to winter so far, as the ChamonixSkiBum explained in his first Alps ski conditions roundup. Based on his explanation, late November was impressively snowy across the Alps, with the northwest region (specifically Savoie in France and Valais in Switzerland) seeing the most. Some areas, like Avoriaz, Flaine, and the Mont Blanc range, saw their snowiest late-November in nearly 30 years, with base depths reaching 1.5\u20132 meters.

Trail Ridge , known in its final years as Nebraski, was a ski area that operated from 1981 to 1996. It was situated between the cities of Omaha and Lincoln, making it accessible to many. The ski area had a short operational history due to its southern exposure and lack of natural snowfall. However, Nerbraski is one of the sickest ski area names ever. In this video by Skiers and Snowboarders of the Midwest , he uses a drone to capture the remains of the ski area. The physical infrastructure appears to have been removed, but you can still see the layout of many of the old ski trails.

Colorado Avalanche Information Center Deputy Director Brian Lazar said the dry start to the season has meant that avalanche risk remained low throughout most of November, due to the lack of snow. This upcoming storm will change that. \u201cIt will certainly be helpful for our snowpack in the longterm,\u201d Lazar said. \u201cHowever, the short-term effects will be a dramatic uptick in avalanche danger as we start to rebuild our snowpack.\u201d Colorado\u2019s northern and central mountains are expected to pick up between 1 to 2 feet of snow, with the potential for up to 3 feet of snow in parts of the Park Range and Flat Tops, according to the CAIC.

On Nov. 27 at Copper Mountain, a man and juvenile were watching the Copper Cup in a restricted area. Sheriff Jaime FitzSimons said neither person should have been in the area. He said the juvenile left, and the man thought the juvenile drew security workers\u2019 attention to the area, leading to the man being kicked out. The two moved to the same public area to watch the event, and the man thought the juvenile, who was taking pictures, stepped in front of him on purpose, FitzSimons said. The man tackled the juvenile, and the juvenile\u2019s camera was damaged in the altercation. After investigating, deputies arrested the man on charges including assault and criminal mischief and took him to the county jail. Three days later, on Nov. 30, at Keystone Resort, a female skier believed a male snowboarder was riding recklessly downhill of her. She skied ahead, stopp",

While the mountain may seem completely desolate, people soon exit the warmth of their car, strap on a head lamp and begin walking to the base of the mountain. In between sleepy yawns, the growing group of people step into their skis, take hold of their poles and begin skinning under the soft morning light and the distant groan of the working snowcat. These athletes will spend the next hour or so before the lifts begin spinning, skinning up the mountain before eventually cruising back down to the base area.
