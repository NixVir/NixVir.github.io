The X9S Beta Race 10.26 draws visual inspiration directly from those championship years while hiding thoroughly modern engineering beneath its nostalgic graphics. Built for aggressive on-piste skiers, the ski features a Multi Radius Sidecut that allows it to snap through short turns while remaining composed and stable in longer GS-style arcs.
