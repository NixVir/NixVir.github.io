These snowboarders were riding at Revelstoke Mountain Resort in British Columbia when the lead boarder fell into a hidden ravine complete with a small stream. View this post on Instagram A post shared by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Allaire (@t.ijay_) It seems like the ravine was covered in snow right up until the lead boarder ran over it causing the snow to collapse. Fortunately it wasn\u2019t that deep and the guy seemed just fine despite the fall. Nonetheless, this video serves as a reminder to ski or ride with a buddy if you\u2019re going to head off trail. No doubt the climb out of the ravine was a battle, and if he was alone and had fallen into something deeper or something without much of an exit path, it could have been a long time before anyone found him.
