From the Mont Blanc massif to the Queyras and across into the Swiss Valais, numerous skier-triggered and spontaneous avalanches point to a snowpack that remains structurally unstable , despite periods of fair weather and already-tracked slopes. Rather than isolated incidents, the reports collected since late January describe reactive slabs, remote triggers, and persistent weak layers affecting a wide range of aspects and elevations. Much of the recent instability is consistent with wind-loaded slabs and foehn-driven snow transport , which can rapidly overload weak layers and create large, reactive avalanche conditions.
