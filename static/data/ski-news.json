From the Mont Blanc massif to the Queyras and across into the Swiss Valais, numerous skier-triggered and spontaneous avalanches point to a snowpack that remains structurally unstable , despite periods of fair weather and already-tracked slopes.

      "content": "The Matterhorn is among the deadliest mountains in the world, with more than 500 deaths on the mountain since 1865. Every year the mountain sees 8-10 deaths, with up to 3000 mountaineers attempting to summit the iconic peak. With a summit altitude of 14,692 feet, it theoretically shouldn\u2019t be incredibly difficult to fly a drone to the summit. However, the concept of flying a $10,000 piece of equipment far beyond your reach seems pretty stressful. Swiss cinematographer Noah Malin took his $10k FPV drone to the Matterhorn to shoot a commercial. Because of the drone\u2019s size, he had to walk up to the H\u00f6rnlih\u00fctte at 10,695 feet. This wasn\u2019t the first time someone\u2019s flown a drone to the summit of the iconic European peak, but the fact that this is a high-end piece of equipment with a very nice camera truly shines in the footage. It\u2019s absolutely stunning to look at. Noah has a ton of very cool drone footage on his YouTube channel, with shots of water, mountains, and stunning scenery. Make sure",
