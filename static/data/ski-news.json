(the company from which the guides were hired). During the 2023-24 season, Brian Thomas Roberts was on a cat-skiing trip. Around that fateful day, the weather at Mt.

From the Mont Blanc massif to the Queyras and across into the Swiss Valais, numerous skier-triggered and spontaneous avalanches point to a snowpack that remains structurally unstable , despite periods of fair weather and already-tracked slopes. Rather than isolated incidents, the reports collected since late January describe reactive slabs, remote triggers, and persistent weak layers affecting a wide range of aspects and elevations. Much of the recent instability is consistent with wind-loaded slabs and foehn-driven snow transport , which can rapidly overload weak layers and create large, reactive avalanche conditions.

It is the first time in the last five years that Cloudmont has opened for a full season . The resort owes this to the tremendous winter storm that plunged more than half the country into freezing temperatures, allowing it to make snow. Cloudmont relies on man-made snow as it only averages two to six inches of snowfall per year.

He holds the world record for the most human-powered vertical feet skied in a year, totaling 3,590,097 feet. For 348 days, Noah skied an average of more than 10,000 feet a day. Alex Hackel is a top-notch skier in his own right, earning both a bronze and silver medal at the X Games in Real Ski. He is not a ski mountaineer, but he decided to race Noah Dines in a skimo race anyways. He gave himself a little boost for the contest, though, wearing the Hypershell X Series exoskeleton to see if it could give him enough of a boost to beat a world record holder. Despite throwing several challenges in Noah\u2019s way, Alex having a mechanical boost, and Alex fully skipping a lap to make it a closer race, Noah was able to secure the win. That said, it is very interesting to see how the exoskeleton gave Alex an overall boost on the uphill, even if it wasn\u2019t enough to beat the world record holder. The Future Of Boot F",
