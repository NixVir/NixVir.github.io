      "content": "The first ever FIS Freeride World Championships went down on Tuesday, February 3rd, at Ordino Arcal\u00eds in Andorra, bringing 65 of the world\u2019s best freeride skiers and snowboarders from 17 nations together for an epic competition. The winning runs were seriously impressive, but it\u2019s pretty hard to understand just how insane these runs really are without seeing it from the athlete\u2019s perspective. Ben Richards won the men\u2019s ski category with a wild run, but his newly released GoPro footage really gives you a new appreciation for the steepness and intensity of the face at Ordino Arcal\u00eds. Ben\u2019s first place finish beat French skier Ugo Troubat, who wound up in second, and American skier Kai Jones, who wound up in third. Make sure you catch every winning run here .

High winds sent spindrift cascading off the surrounding walls as they moved toward their objective, eventually establishing camp deep in the Valley of the Ten Peaks . Conditions shifted overnight.

The lawsuit is against the Diamond Lake Improvement Company (which owns the cat-skiing operations), the three guides, and Sierra Wilderness Seminars Inc. (the company from which the guides were hired). During the 2023-24 season, Brian Thomas Roberts was on a cat-skiing trip. Around that fateful day, the weather at Mt. Bailey featured freezing rain, heavy snow, and wind. Despite the avalanche report saying the risk was high, the trip leaders continued skiing that day because the report didn\u2019t apply to Mt. Bailey. These guides were reportedly inexperienced with Mt. Bailey, which at least one more experienced guide brought up as a concern.

From the Mont Blanc massif to the Queyras and across into the Swiss Valais, numerous skier-triggered and spontaneous avalanches point to a snowpack that remains structurally unstable , despite periods of fair weather and already-tracked slopes. Rather than isolated incidents, the reports collected since late January describe reactive slabs, remote triggers, and persistent weak layers affecting a wide range of aspects and elevations.

      "content": "Noah Dines is pretty much as close to superhuman as one can get in ski mountaineering. He holds the world record for the most human-powered vertical feet skied in a year, totaling 3,590,097 feet. For 348 days, Noah skied an average of more than 10,000 feet a day. Alex Hackel is a top-notch skier in his own right, earning both a bronze and silver medal at the X Games in Real Ski. He is not a ski mountaineer, but he decided to race Noah Dines in a skimo race anyways. He gave himself a little boost for the contest, though, wearing the Hypershell X Series exoskeleton to see if it could give him enough of a boost to beat a world record holder. Despite throwing several challenges in Noah\u2019s way, Alex having a mechanical boost, and Alex fully skipping a lap to make it a closer race, Noah was able to secure the win. That said, it is very interesting to see how the exoskeleton gave Alex an overall boost on the uphill, even if it wasn\u2019t enough to beat the world record holder. The Future Of Boot F",

What sets the descent apart is not only its rarity, but its fidelity to the original vision of the route. The Comstock Couloir was first skied by Greg Hill and partners and published in The Fifty Classic Ski Descents of North America as a full-value ski mountaineering objective. Rather than a single couloir lap, the route calls for a long and committing traverse of Dawson Ridge, a summit of Mount Dawson ( the second-highest peak in the",
