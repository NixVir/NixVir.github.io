In the midst of an eerily dry Colorado winter, Aspen has the most skiable terrain in Colorado right now, with several thousand acres open for riding across all skill levels. For my first day in Aspen and day one of the Winter X-Games, I cruised around Buttermilk Mountain, enjoyed beautiful vistas, some rolling groomers, and perfect park laps, and watched as world-class athletes practiced for their events and then competed at the highest level.

In Rise & Alpine\u2019s latest video, he takes his fianc\u00e9e on her first-ever trip to Revelstoke Mountain Resort. However, I\u2019d argue the major story from this one is what happened before the ski day. While staying overnight at a hotel in Revelstoke, their attempts at sleeping were foiled by a group of rowdy guests. Throughout the evening, a group of guests kept making noise in the outdoor hot tub, which included bringing a bench into the water. What followed were shouting matches with other guests and hotel management. Eventually, the po-po stopped by the hot tub, but it wasn\u2019t to take a soak. It\u2019s an entertaining watch. If you\u2019re curious about which hotel they were staying at, it\u2019s the Stoke Hotel, which is part of the Best Western brand. It has a Google rating of 4.1 out of 5, which is decent, but noise is an issue. On the bright side, th",

In this video, Brian Basconi shares his near-catastrophic crash on the Kiwi Flats at Mammoth Mountain. Situated off Chair 23, Kiwi Flats is one of the more technical chutes (if not the toughest trail) at the California ski resort. When Brian drops in, he accumulates a lot of speed. When Brian tries to get a turn to slow his momentum, he crashes and begins sliding down a rock-filled chute. Probably the craziest part of the video is when his right ski dislodged; it originally flew past him down the slope. However, as he picked up speed, that same ski came close to striking him. Remarkably, not only did he not get hurt by any of the equipment, but Basconi also left the crash unscathed. He attributed the slide to watching \u201ctoo many Nikolai Schirmer videos the night before.\u201d This Guy\u2019s Crash Is A Perfect Guide On How NOT To Ski Corbet\u2019s Couloir Image/Video Credits: Brian Basconi , ",

Born in Victoria in 1993, Brockhoff first hit the slopes as a toddler and was already winning national school titles by age ten. After debuting on the World Cup circuit as a teenager, she made the switch to Snowboard Cross, a move that would see her become one of Australia\u2019s most successful and influential winter athletes. Across three Olympic campaigns in Sochi 2014, PyeongChang 2018, and Beijing 2022, Brockhoff was a consistent force on the world stage, highlighted by an eighth-place finish in her Olympic debut and a close fourth-place result in Beijing. Her World Cup career featured multiple podiums, including a historic gold medal in 2015 when she became the first Australian female to win a Snowboard Cross World Cup.
