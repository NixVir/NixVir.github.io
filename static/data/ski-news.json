From the Mont Blanc massif to the Queyras and across into the Swiss Valais, numerous skier-triggered and spontaneous avalanches point to a snowpack that remains structurally unstable , despite periods of fair weather and already-tracked slopes. Rather than isolated incidents, the reports collected since late January describe reactive slabs, remote triggers, and persistent weak layers affecting a wide range of aspects and elevations. Much of the recent instability is consistent with wind-loaded slabs and foehn-driven snow transport , which can rapidly overload weak layers and create large, reactive avalanche conditions.

Priced at nearly $3 million, 3384 Route 52 is home to a piece of New York skiing history. The five-parcel property features the former Mount Storm Ski Area , which last operated in the 1980s. It closed due to a fire at the main base lodge and rising insurance costs. Arguably, the main attraction here is the basement of the main building. In the basement is the old ski rental shop, which still includes the old skis, boots, and signs. The building itself has been converted to three separate three-bedroom apartments. The land still features some relics of the ski area, including an abandoned lift and a snow groomer. The zoning with this former ski area is pretty interesting. Part of the land is an agricultural district for farm use. Other portions of the land are residential, which could lead to more residential or apartment development. While its lift-served ski days ar",
