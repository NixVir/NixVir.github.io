Mount Bohemia is keeping skiing and snowboarding wild, with the most unique vibe I\u2019ve ever experienced. Would a $99 season pass get you stoked for the season? Yeah, me too.

During the escape he was shot and fell off a cliff breaking his leg. Klaus managed to get out of the mountains alive and was found by a sympathetic nurse who hid him in a Swiss hospital until the WW2 was over.

Rocky Mountain Outlook reported last month that the current owners of Fortress Mountain Resort are working on a plan for the revival of the ski resort.
