Frustration is common, especially during short holidays or peak winter weeks. But more snow does not automatically mean safer skiing . In fact, the period immediately after heavy snowfall is often when avalanche risk is highest. Terrain closures following big storms are not a failure to open \u2014 they are a deliberate risk-management decision designed to protect lives . Heavy snowfall doesn\u2019t automatically mean safe skiing Large snowfalls can dramatically increase instability in the snowpack. Factors that contribute to heightened risk include: rapid accumulation of fresh snow wind loading on leeward slopes weak layers buried beneath new snow limited visibility preventing safe assessment In many cases, the first 24 to 72 hours after a storm are critical.

Well, not above the actual Ozone Layer, but the trail right below that is called Ozone. Aspen Highlands is one of four Aspen ski areas. It\u2019s the steep one, the really really steep one. According to the Highlands\u2019 snow report , they are currently 94% open in terms of acreage; however, none of this terrain is for beginners. What makes this ski area so special is that it has no green runs, and it boasts an absolutely massive bowl (270 skiable acres) that is only accessible via roughly a 45-minute, breathtaking hike. That is exactly how I started my day: with a quick warm-up run and then straight to the bowl. The hike up to the peak is equally as challenging, rewarding, and exhilarating an experience as the way down the bowl. There is one especially long and steep se",

Earlier this month, it was revealed by the Colorado Sun and Telluride Times that an offer was made to the owner of Telluride Ski Resort during the ski patrol strike to purchase it. However, that meeting led to political turmoil in the community. The Meeting Late last month, two town officials from Telluride and the Mountain Village traveled to meet with TelSki owner Chuck Horning in Southern California. The meeting was intended to discuss the ski patrol strike and leadership deficiencies at the ski resort. The two representatives were Mountain Village Mayor Marti Prohaska and Telluride Mayor Pro Tem Meehan Fee. During the December 29th meeting, the two told Horning that a group of investors was interested in taking a 51% stake in the ski resort for $127.5 million. As part of this deal, Horning would have remained the Chairman of the board. The two signed a contract with Horning to resolve conflic",
