In theory, one solution is cloud seeding, but its effectiveness is debatable. Bloomberg News reported last week that various states and ski resorts are using cloud seeding to increase snowfall totals from snowstorms. Colorado and Utah are currently leading the way, but the results aren\u2019t definitive enough to solve the West\u2019s drought. There are a few methods that are used for cloud seeding. Near Winter Park Resort, a machine places silver iodide into the arm. When storms approach, they can increase precipitation. Alternatively, on cloudy days with no expected precipitation, it can produce snow. This operation is run by DRI, a non-profit research firm. Winter Park estimates that it helped produce 24 inches of snow in 2024. Some of these systems are manually run, while newer ones are remotely operated for more secluded locations. \u201cIf you ask me, it enhances the ef",
