Aspen, Colorado, most famously known for hosting the annual Winter X Games, is home to four mountains that offer excellent, unique skiing and snowboarding experiences. In the midst of an eerily dry Colorado winter, Aspen has the most skiable terrain in Colorado right now, with several thousand acres open for riding across all skill levels. For my first day in Aspen and day one of the Winter X-Games, I cruised around Buttermilk Mountain, enjoyed beautiful vistas, some rolling groomers, and perfect park laps, and watched as world-class athletes practiced for their events and then competed at the highest level.

      "content": "Like Babe Ruth stepping up to the plate in the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs and pointing to the bleachers before crushing a homerun to deep center field, this skier called his shot by drawing a line in the snow before delivering a well placed stomp that released a cornice that immediately triggered an avalanche. Releasing an overhanging mass of snow formed by wind deposits (triggering a cornice fall) in the backcountry may be a satisfying experience and mitigate dangerous build ups on ridgelines but being in the position to do so is dangerous in itself and should only be performed by trained professionals. Learn more about cornice fall safety below. AVALANCHE.ORG CORNICE SAFETY: Cornices grow through the winter on the leeward side of wind exposed ridges and summits. Cornices range from small wind lips of soft snow to overhangs of hard snow larger than a school bus. They can break off the terrain suddenly and unexpectedly and can sometimes be triggered from a distance. Ove",

The council approved the motion, presented by members of the Union Vald\u00f4taine and Stella Alpina \u2013 Rassemblement Vald\u00f4tain , with 25 votes in favour out of 27 . Two councillors voted against it, but the overall support highlights broad political and community interest in exploring the proposal further. The sleepy town of Cogne, which is usually much colder than Aosta as it is in altitude, it is pretty cut off from the main valley, but part of its charm is that! Renown for its cross-country skiing, it has also a smaller alpine skiing resort, which is the one that they want to join to Pila. Photo: The-Ski-Guru.
