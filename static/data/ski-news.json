Purely natural snow resorts are currently benefiting from the snow conditions and are following suit. Particularly pleasing is the high demand for ski courses, primarily among young people, and the large number of sunbathers who, in addition to winter sports enthusiasts, are drawn to the mountains by the fantastic winter weather.
