      "content": "The man behind the camera filming his friend triggering a massive cornice fall may have been chuckling but cornice safety is no laughing matter. Releasing an overhanging mass of snow formed by wind deposits (triggering a cornice fall) can lead to snow immersion suffocation (SIS) when the skier lands and trigger avalanches or simply entrain large amounts of loose snow along with the cornice debris which is also a dangerous scenario. Many cornice fall accidents are caused by skiers and snowboarder venturing too far out onto corniced ridgelines which should be avoided. In the video below, the downhill skier had a visual on the cornice and should have directed his friend to find a safer entry point rather than pulling out his phone to film. The filmer also put himself in perilous position as this cornice fall could have easily triggered an avalanche that could have caught and carried him. Read more about cornice fall safety below.
