While many locals in ski towns dread the crowds, locals in Telluride are hoping that people show up. Last Thursday , the Telluride Ski Patrol Union reached an agreement with the ski resort. The ski resort began growing its trail and lift count on Saturday. But how are the ski resort and the area doing now? CBS Colorado reported earlier this week that businesses are still struggling despite the ski resort gradually opening up more terrain and lifts. Bookings are reportedly down 50% compared to the same time last year due to those who cancelled because of the strike.

Unfortunately those deep conditions brought their own danger, with quite a few avalanche deaths occurring throughout the mountain range in the past week. The northern and western Alps saw up to a meter, or a little over 3 feet, in a 3-4 day span from Wednesday through Saturday. It wasn\u2019t the biggest storm of the season, but it brought some exceptional conditions. The best snow was found in Savoie, Les 3 Vall\u00e9es, the Chamonix area, and parts of Switzerland and Austria. Unfortunately the conditions in the Dolomites weren\u2019t quite as good. Warm temperatures and wind transformed much of the snow by Monday and Tuesday, turning much of the powder into crusty or slushy conditions. While groomed runs are excellent, the off-piste powder is getting much harder to find. Tragically at least 6 people died in avalanches in France alone over the last week, with m",

As part of the podcast, they interviewed Joe Prokop (longtime Alta passholder), Sam Weintrub (Co-Founder of PeakRankings), and Glen Merrill (SLC meteorologist with the National Weather Service) to discuss the issues that Utah ski industry faces. They discuss the following issues: overcrowding in the mountains, the impact of multi-mountain passes on lift lines and parking, and Utah\u2019s changing climate. Why I Don\u2019t Think It\u2019s Going Bust It\u2019s true that Utah\u2019s most uncrowded days are behind it. The times that fixed-grip lifts helped Utah hold onto powder for days are over.

These lots are a part of the Gold Hill Estates . According to their website, the two lots are going for $1,399,500 and $1,850,000.

The typical rule is that the skis should stand somewhere between your chin and the top of your head, but knowing exactly where the skis should lie within that range is a bit more complicated. For those who don\u2019t know, shorter skis are more nimble and easier to turn, but they tend to be less stable at high speeds. Longer, on the other hand, means much more stability at speed, but they can be significantly harder to turn and usually require dialed-in technique. Professional skier Alex Hackel compared some of the shortest skis available on the market to some of the longest, really emphasizing their differences. If you\u2019re a beginner or just generally in the market for a new pair of skis and aren\u2019t sure what to get, you should head into a ski shop and talk to someone who knows what they\u2019re doing.

View this post on Instagram Around 440 million years ago, during the Ordovician period, the ancient Iapetus Ocean began to close off. A volcanic island arc collided with the edge of Laurentia (proto-North America) triggering the Taconic Orogeny (a major mountain-building event) . This collision thrust massive sheets of rock westward, creating what geologists call the Taconic Allochthon where older metamorphic rocks like slate, phyllite, and schist pushed over younger sedimentary layers. The modern Taconics are the eroded remnants of those ancient highlands, with summits like Mount Greylock (3,491 ft in Massachusetts) ",

Helicopter pilots don\u2019t like to fly in zero-visibility clouds. Once the clouds cleared, we got two fantastic runs on our first afternoon (Friday). It was waist-deep. When you jumped out of the helicopter at the drop-off, you sank to your waist in soft and light snow. The 116mm underfoot K2 Crescendo skis they recommended I use were exactly what I needed.

The plan was simple: go chip at some ice and get back in the flow with the technique. In ice climbing, you want to try to have a solid base with your footing and to get the ice axes over the tops of each other to have the most leverage. John Kingsland chipping axes one over the other.

      "content": "Wales \u2014 It sounds like a new massive ski resort is coming to the U.K. TimeOut reports that the Rhydycar West development has been approved by two critical sources. The Welsh government approved the plans in November 2025, and Merthyr Tydfil council gave the plans the thumbs-up last week. If built, the \u00a3300 million (around $403 million) Rhydycar West would feature an indoor ski centre, an indoor water park, an adventure centre (which would have climbing walls and ziplines), a spa, various accommodation options, and convention spaces. It would make the sleepy town of Merthyr Tydfil into a vacation destination. Currently, the town is known as the gateway to the Brecon Beacons National Park, but it needs further development to grow its economy.

The main slope is expected to be 400 meters long (around .25 miles)",
