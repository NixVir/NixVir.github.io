The subscription-like model of multi-mountain passes has generated reliable revenue for major ski resort corporations, particularly Vail Resorts and the Alterra Mountain Company. It\u2019s proven to be a vital source of income during low-snow years, such as the one we\u2019re living through. It\u2019s allowed skiers to basically go to any ski region for vacation, but it also has brought crowds. A relatively new video from Bloomberg Television dives into the mega-pass model and how it has propelled Vail and Alterra into household names among skiers. Bloomberg interviewed Rob Katz, CEO of Vail Resorts, and Jared Smith, the CEO of Alterra Mountain Company, to ask them how the industry has changed.

In the 1990s, Arapahoe Basin, Breckenridge, and Keystone were sold to Vail, when it was much smaller. However, the DOJ ",
